            <h2>Service Descriptions</h2>
			<p>Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run applications in isolated environments called containers. This allows you to run multiple applications on the same machine without having to worry about them interfering with each other.</p>
			<p>For this project, I've set up a Docker Compose file that will run the following containers:</p>
			<ul>
                <section>
                    <h3>NGINX</h3>
                    <p>NGINX is a web server that can be used as a reverse proxy. This means that it can forward requests to other servers based on the request's URL. In this case, NGINX is forwarding requests to the WordPress container.</p>
